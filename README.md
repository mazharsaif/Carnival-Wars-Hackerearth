## Problem statement
Halloween is a night of costumes, fun, and candy that takes place every year on October 31. On this day people dress up in various costumes that have a scary overtone and go trick-or-treating to gather candy.

This year, on Halloween, there is a carnival in your neighborhood. Besides the various games, there are also 50 stalls that are selling various products, which fall under various categories.

Your task is to predict the selling price of the products based on the provided features.
